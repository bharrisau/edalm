edalm
=======

Library manager for EDA tools.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g edalm
    
## Quick Start

 Only some of the features are implemented. At the moment edalm will read part definitions and generate either a Kicad symbol library (.lib file), or a Kicad footprint library (.kicad_mod files).
 Some example part definitions are available in the doc folder.
 
 Generate symbols

    $ edalm symbols
     
 Generate footprints

    $ edalm footprints 
    
 Default part folder is 'parts'.
